# ComfyUI Nodes for Generating Prompts for All Media Creations (Image, Video, Audio, Text)

Currently supports DeepSeek-R1/V3, Alibaba Cloud Qwen (almost all models), and Google Gemini (including the `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation` model for image editing with your mouth). More useful APIs will be added in the future.  Contributions with useful APIs are welcome.

Will also add a curated selection of local models, each kept separate for easy use.  Just download the ones you want.

## üì£ Updates

[2025-04-01] ‚öíÔ∏è: Released version v1.0.0.

- Supports DeepSeek-R1/V3 model API.  Requires an API key. Obtain a key from the [DeepSeek website](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). Then set the environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = <your key>`. See [Configuring API Keys Using Environment Variables](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/configure-api-key-through-environment-variables?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.38b26132lodett#e4cd73d544i3r) for setup instructions.  You can also input the key directly in the node, but **be sure to keep your key confidential and do not expose it in your workflows.**  **On Windows, restarting your computer after adding the environment variable may be necessary for the change to take effect.**
